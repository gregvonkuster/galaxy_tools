The directories here contain file that enable additional Postgres
databases to complement the Galaxy database.  These databases are
used by separate, unrelated applications (CoralSNP and PlantTribes)
in order to function.  The following information can be used by a
system administrator to configure a local Galaxy environment to
support one of these applications.

CoralSNP Application
====================

~/config
    - job_conf.xml - an example configuration file for using slurm
                     as the local job runner with 8 processes
    /corals 
        - coralsnp_reports.yml - an example coralsnp_reports.yml
                                 file
        - etc/nginx/galaxy.conf - and example nginx configuration
                                  file for serving Galaxy via
                                  nginx
        - galaxy.yml.multi - an example configuration file for
                             serving Galaxy with multiple web
                             front-end processes and multipl job
                             runner processes
        - galaxy.yml.single - an example configuration file for
                              serving Galaxy in single-user mode
    - slurm.conf - and exampl configuration file for serving Galaxy
                   with the slurm jpb runner

~/corals_database - serves https://coralsnp.science.psu.edu/galaxy
    /galaxy_integration
        /version_1909 - core Galaxy version 19.09 code files altered
                        to support the complementary CoralSNP model.
                        These files are located in subdirectories 
                        relative to the local Galaxy installation
                        root directory.  Simply copy each file to it's
                        respective location (e.g., ~/lib/galaxy/config)
                        relative to the Galaxy installation root.
    /lib - core CoralSNP code files that must be placed in the 
           subdirectores relative to the Galaxy installation root.
    /stag_database_seed_data - seed data files used to initially
                               populate the stag database during
                               initial setup.


~/coralsnp_reports - serves https://coralsnp.science.psu.edu/reports
                     core CoralSNP code files that must be placed in
                     the cubdirectories relative to the Galaxy
                     installation root.


~/lib - example (optional) job rules file to include selection of
        number of processors to use on specified tool forms.



PlantTribes Application
=======================

~/lib - example (optional) job rules file to include selection of
        number of processors to use on specified tool forms.

~/plant_tribes_database - core Galaxy code files to support the
                          complementary plant_tribes model.
