In unaligned sum, Mean = 24 Std = 0 Hotpixel threshold = 24
Detected 0 hot pixels to be corrected.
Fixed hot pixels.

Global alignment:
 Iteration 1: RMSD = 0 px

Local alignments:
Patches: X = 1 Y = 1
Too few patches to do local alignments. Local alignment is skipped.
Summing frames before dose weighting: ........................ done
Written aligned but non-dose weighted sum to ./frame1.mrc
